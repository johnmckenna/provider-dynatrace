                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default

                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
