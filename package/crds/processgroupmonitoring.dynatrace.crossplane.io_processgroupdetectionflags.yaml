                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out
                  through a Crossplane feature flag.
                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.
                  See the design doc for more information: https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/499895a25d1a1a0ba1604944ef98ac7a1a71f197/design/design-doc-observe-only-resources.md?plain=1#L223

                      To determine the unique identity of each detected process, and to generate a unique name for each detected process, Dynatrace evaluates the name of the directory that each process binary is contained within. For application containers like Tomcat and JBoss, Dynatrace evaluates important directories like CATALINA_HOME and JBOSS_HOME for this information. In some automated deployment scenarios such directory names are updated automatically with new version numbers, build numbers, dates, or GUIDs. Enable this setting to ensure that automated directory name changes don't result in Dynatrace registering pre-existing processes as new processes.
