                  for example because of an external controller is managing them, like an

                  THIS IS A BETA FIELD. It is on by default but can be opted out

                  ManagementPolicies specify the array of actions Crossplane is allowed to
                  take on the managed and external resources.
                  This field is planned to replace the DeletionPolicy field in a future
                  release. Currently, both could be set independently and non-default
                  values would be honored if the feature flag is enabled. If both are
                  custom, the DeletionPolicy field will be ignored.

                  WriteConnectionSecretToReference specifies the namespace and name of a
                  Secret to which any connection details for this managed resource should
                  be written. Connection details frequently include the endpoint, username,
                  and password required to connect to the managed resource.
                  This field is planned to be replaced in a future release in favor of
                  PublishConnectionDetailsTo. Currently, both could be set independently
                  and connection details would be published to both without affecting
                  each other.
